# Human-Centered Data_Visualization_Book

Welcome! 

These are the lecture notes of the course ''Data Visualization - From a Human-Centered Perspective'' provided by [Claudia MÃ¼ller-Birn](http://clmb.de). It is a first draft and I expect many mistakes, however, it is a start and I am looking forward to receiving your comments and ideas for additions. 

This course gives students an introduction to the fundamentals of data visualization with current insights from research and practice. 

Further information about the course can be found on our [homepage](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/teaching/index.html).
